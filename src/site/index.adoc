= Log4j Scala API

{project-name} provides a Scala-friendly interface to log against {log4j-api-url}[the Log4j API].
It supports Scala `2.10`, `2.11`, `2.12`, `2.13`, and `3`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This is just a logging API.
Your application still needs to have a logging backend (e.g., {log4j-url}[Log4j]) configured.
====

[#dependencies]
== Dependencies

You need to have the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api-scala` dependency in your classpath:

[source,sbt,subs="+attributes"]
----
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.apache.logging.log4j" %% "log4j-api-scala" % "{project-version}"
)
----

Java module name is set to `org.apache.logging.log4j.api.scala`.
OSGi ``Bundle-SymbolicName``s are set to `org.apache.logging.log4j.api.scala.2.10`, `org.apache.logging.log4j.api.scala.2.11`, and so on.

[#usage]
== Usage

Using the Scala API is as simple as mixing in the `Logging` trait to your class:

[source,scala]
----
import org.apache.logging.log4j.scala.Logging
import org.apache.logging.log4j.Level

class MyClass extends BaseClass with Logging {

  def doStuff(): Unit = {
    logger.info("Doing stuff")
  }

  def doStuffWithLevel(level: Level): Unit = {
    logger(level, "Doing stuff with arbitrary level")
  }

  def doStuffWithUser(user: User): Unit = {
    logger.info(s"Doing stuff with ${user.getName}.")
  }

}
----

[#params]
== Parameter substitution

Unlike in Java, Scala provides native functionality for string interpolation https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/string-interpolation.html[beginning in Scala 2.10].
As all logger calls are implemented as macros, using string interpolation directly does not require additional if checks:

[source,scala]
----
logger.debug(s"Logging in user ${user.getName} with birthday ${user.calcBirthday}")
----

[#logger-names]
== Logger names

Most logging implementations use a hierarchical scheme for matching logger names with logging configuration.
In this scheme the logger name hierarchy is represented by `.` characters in the logger name, in a fashion very similar to the hierarchy used for Java/Scala package names.
The `Logger` property added by the `Logging` trait follows this convention: the trait ensures the `Logger` is automatically named according to the class it is being used in.

[#development]
== Development

{project-name} uses {project-github-url}[GitHub] for source code management.

The project requires two Java compilers to build:

. `8` (required for Scala `2.10` and `2.11`)
. one matching the `{java-compiler-version}` range.

You can build and verify sources using:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw verify
----

You can build and view the website as follows:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw -N site
python -m http.server -d target/site
----

[#distribution]
== Distribution

In accordance with the Apache Software Foundation's release https://infra.apache.org/release-distribution.html[distribution policy] and https://infra.apache.org/release-publishing.html[creation process], project artifacts are _officially_ accessible from the following locations:

* ASF https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/releases[Release] and https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots[snapshot] repositories (mirrored to https://central.sonatype.dev/[the Maven Central Repository])
* ASF https://downloads.apache.org/logging/{project-id}[Distribution directory]

See xref:#release-instructions[the release instructions] for details.

[#cyclonedx-sbom]
=== CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

Starting with version `13.1.0`, {project-name} distributes https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/sbom/[CyclenoDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)] along with each deployed artifact.
This is streamlined by `logging-parent`, see https://logging.apache.org/logging-parent/latest/#cyclonedx-sbom[its website] for details.

[#support]
== Support

Please keep in mind that this project is intended for internal usage only.
You can use GitHub Issues for feature requests and bug reports â€“ not questions!
See https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/support.html[the Log4j support policy] for details.

[#security]
== Security

If you have encountered an unlisted security vulnerability or other unexpected behaviour that has security impact, please report them privately to mailto:security@logging.apache.org[the Log4j security mailing list].
See https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html[the Log4j Security page] for further details.
